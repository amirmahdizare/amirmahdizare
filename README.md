# Hi there! My name is Amir Mahdi (AMKZ)

I am a front-end developer with over 3 years of experience. I specialize in using Javascript, Typescript, Reactjs, and Next Js to create stunning web applications. Throughout my career, I have developed numerous industrial projects that have helped me gain a deeper understanding of the industry's nuances.

One thing that sets me apart from others is my eye for design. I believe that a well-designed website not only looks great but also functions smoothly. I always strive to create user-friendly interfaces that make navigating through the website a breeze.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. I am passionate about what I do and am always looking for new and exciting projects to work on.

Thank you for taking the time to read my about me! If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me.
